# xxd-zig

## Ã€ propos

This project attempts to clone the behavior of the `xxd` command-line utility in the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org). The goal of the project is for the author to learn something about the Zig language.

This project uses [the CLAP library v0.10.0](https://github.com/Hejsil/zig-clap/releases/tag/0.10.0) for command-line argument parsing.

The original `xxd` is packaged with `vim`: [https://github.com/vim/vim/tree/master/src/xxd](https://github.com/vim/vim/tree/master/src/xxd).

## What differences does this program have over the original `xxd`?

- When using the "plain" postscript output, you may render the data in binary
- You may reverse "plain" postscript dumps of binary and hex data
- You may use an odd-number of columns in the output, for whatever strange
  reason you may want to do that
- Speed: this program is between three (3) and six (6) times faster than `xxd`,
         depending on the options used
- Size: this program's binary is about five (5) times larger than `xxd`

## Remaining to-do items

 - write more tests
 - look into using a different memory allocator for better performance
 - test for memory leaks
 - improve error handling for the command-line arguments
 - choose a better name - "xzd" ?
 - color bytes above 0x7F in bright red like `xxd` does (as well as the
   byte immediately after)
