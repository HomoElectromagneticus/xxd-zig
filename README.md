# xxd-zig
This project attempts to clone the behavior of the `xxd` command-line utility in the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org). The goal of the project is for the author to learn something about the Zig language.

This project uses [the CLAP library](https://github.com/Hejsil/zig-clap) for command-line argument parsing.

The original `xxd` is packaged with `vim`: [https://github.com/vim/vim/tree/master/src/xxd](https://github.com/vim/vim/tree/master/src/xxd).
